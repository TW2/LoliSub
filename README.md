LoliSub

Just looking for lolis when fansubbing or just pick up waifu.

/!\ Help wanted to implement libass /!\

This project runs on Java 24 or above, you can use OpenJDK 24, Temurin 24 or Oracle JDK 24 (and maybe buy it if you are a society).<br>
LoliSub is available for free and opensource, that lets you modify it under the same licensing which is GNU/GPLv3. You must install at least Java to run to after compilation. If you want to compile the code yourself you have to get git, maven and the clone of this project in the normal way.

Just do the following command to work with LoliSub :<br>
1/ ```git clone https://github.com/TW2/LoliSub.git``` in your Terminal (Windows : CMD or Terminal or Powershell)<br>
2/ In the folder created by the command ```git clone```, type ```mvn verify``` in your Terminal.<br>
3/ Enter target subfolder and type ```java -jar``` a space and the shaded version of lolisub following by ```.jar```.

It is recommanded to launch the software by a Terminal. The reason is that you can read the errors while the shortcut way just crash with nothing to tell you why it does it.

LoliSub actual features :<br>
- Available in English and French (auto)
- Not automatical but functional light/dark mode
- Open and save ASS files in a table
- Open and play video (video component and waveform, but don't play on waveform)
- Open audio (waveform, but don't play on waveform)

You can join me on Discord to speak or idle, in English or French (cause I'm a half white black Frenchy).
