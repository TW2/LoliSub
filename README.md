LoliSub
-
Just looking for lolis when fansubbing or just pick up waifu.

- **Developed with OpenJDK 25** (compatibility with Temurin 25/Oracle JDK 25/Graal VM 25).
- Free and opensource, just follow the rules of GNU/GPLv3.

Compilation
-
You may use maven and git and java (and correct paths setting in your os).
<br>Follow these steps in a Terminal :

- ```git clone https://github.com/TW2/LoliSub.git```
- Enter the ```LoliSub``` subfolder and type ```mvn compile``` and ```mvn verify``` or just ```mvn verify```.
- Enter the ```target``` subfolder and type ```java -jar``` a space and the shaded version of lolisub following by ```.jar```.

It is recommanded to launch the software by a Terminal to see errors, just make a sh script in Linux/MacOS systems, and batch on Windows 10/11. If you have the latest version of Windows, all batch scripts are blocked by security manager so make a Powershell script.
